This project aims to showcase my understanding of HTML tags and attributes by creating four HTML pages, each containing a different food recipe that I personally enjoy.
By utilizing a variety of HTML tags, I will demonstrate my ability to structure content effectively, provide semantic meaning to different elements, and enhance the overall user experience. Through this project, I aim to showcase my knowledge in utilizing HTML for web development.
