        <li>Squeeze the juice of the other half of the lime into the glass.</li>
        <li>Fill the glass with ice cubes to the brim.</li>
        <li>Top off the glass with soda water, leaving some space for stirring.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon or a cocktail stirrer to gently mix the ingredients together, ensuring the flavors are evenly
            distributed.</li>
        <li>Garnish the cocktail with a sprig of fresh mint and a slice of lime.</li>
        <li>Serve the mojito immediately and enjoy its invigorating flavors.</li>
