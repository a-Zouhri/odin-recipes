    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, etc.)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature indicated on your pizza dough package or to 475°F (245°C) if you're
            using homemade dough.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. If using store-bought dough, follow
            the package instructions for any necessary resting or rising time.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a baking sheet or a pizza stone dusted with flour or cornmeal to prevent
            sticking.</li>
        <li>Brush the surface of the dough with olive oil to create a barrier and prevent it from becoming soggy.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the
            crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your preferred toppings, such as pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, or any other ingredients
            you like. Be creative!</li>
        <li>Season the pizza with a pinch of salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, if desired.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is
            golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. This allows the cheese to
            set slightly and makes it easier to slice.</li>
        <li>Slice the pizza into wedges or squares and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
